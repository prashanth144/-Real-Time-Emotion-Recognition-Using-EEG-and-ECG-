# -Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-Using-EEG-and-ECG-
• Collect and process EEG &amp; ECG signals using OpenBCI hardware for emotion recognition.
• Apply signal preprocessing techniques (filtering, noise removal, feature extraction) to biosignals . 
• Implement machine learning models emotion classification.  
• Working towards a real-time prototype for human emotion monitoring and recognition.
